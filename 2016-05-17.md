### docker - How to cache node_modules / gems / mix / etc packages in Docker

Use this method to cache dependencies in it's own layer in a docker image.  It will save lots of image building time, plus Docker will know to bust the cache whenever you add / remove dependencies from your app.

1. Add your package.json, Gemfile, mix.exs, etc to the Docker image, e.g: `Add package.json package.json`
2. Install things, e.g. `RUN npm install`
3. *Then* add your app directory (`ADD . ./app`)

### node - 100% correct way to update an npm package that has been shrinkwrapped

1. Remove package with `npm uninstall <package>@<version>`
2. `npm update --save`
3. `npm shrinkwrap`

### node - npm rebuild

`npm rebuild` is a handy command - it will automatically recompile binaries in `node_modules` for a given OS arch.  Useful if you're on a team with folks on different OSes but still need a handy way to make everything 'just work'.

### React - Prefer `.call` over binding a function

When passing a function that uses `this.props` or `this.refs` into a component, prefer to set the `this` context when executing the function with `.call`.  If you just use `bind` before passing the function in, it will likely work for `this.props`, but will break `this.refs` (since the refs are all set and created on the components end).
