### How to cache node_modules / gems / mix / etc packages in Docker

Use this method to cache dependencies in it's own layer in a docker image.  It will save lots of image building time, plus Docker will know to bust the cache whenever you add / remove dependencies from your app.

1. Add your package.json, Gemfile, mix.exs, etc to the Docker image, e.g: `Add package.json package.json`
2. Install things, e.g. `RUN npm install`
3. *Then* add your app directory (`ADD . ./app`)
